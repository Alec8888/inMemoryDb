## README Modifications

Consider designating a specific programming language. While it could potentially restrict a student to a language they are not familiar with, it would make for easier grading. The requested program is simple enough that any student should be able to use a common language like javascript or python to implement. If not specifying the programming language, then could require certain unit tests be written. Such unit tests would aid in the grading process. On another note, the sample tests were helpful but poorly formatted. Some of the comments and lines could be grouped together when they are logically working together to test an outcome.
